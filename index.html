        <img src="../assets/images/bitcoin-about.jpg">
        <p>
            Bitcoin is a new type of digital money and, just like with all money,
            you can store it, exchange it, and make payments with it. The key to that
            makes Bitcoin different from national currencies like the US Dollar, the
            Euro or the Japanese Yen lies in its decentralized structure and opt-in model.
            What does that mean? With centralized 'fiat money' (literally money by decree), 
            currency is issued by central banks, and citizens are forced to use the money 
            of their nation. With the exception of cash (which is becoming increasingly rare)
            transactions are made through intermediaries like banks and payment gateways. Bitcoin,
            by contrast, is an opt-in currency that is controlled by the 'consensus' or the will
            of its users. It consists of a growing network of people who voluntarily agree to the
            rules of the Bitcoin protocol. They use decentralized infrastructure to make transactions
            on a peer-to-peer basis and to store value independently of any government, company, 
            or financial institution. There's no need to ask for permission to use Bitcoin,
            and there's no risk of being cut off from the system. Importantly, 
            the system itself is headless and distributed globally, 
            making it both resistant to corruption and extremely durable.

        <h2 id="part2">How It Works</h2>   
            <img src="../assets/images/bitcoin-basics.jpg">
            <h3>The basics for a new user</h3>
        <p>
            As a new user, you can get started with Bitcoin without understanding
            the technical details. Once you've installed a Bitcoin wallet on your
            computer or mobile phone, it will generate your first Bitcoin address
            and you can create more whenever you need one. You can disclose your
            addresses to your friends so that they can pay you or vice versa.
            In fact, this is pretty similar to how email works,
            except that Bitcoin addresses should be used only once.

        <h3>Balances Block-chain</h3>
        <p>
            The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies.
            All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain.
            It allows Bitcoin wallets to calculate their spendable balance
            so that new transactions can be verified thereby ensuring they're actually owned
            by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the Block Chain are
            enforced withÂ cryptography.

        <h3>Transactions-Private Keys</h3>
        <p>
            A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included
            in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private
            key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof
            that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents
            the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued.
            All transactions are broadcast to the network and usually begin to be confirmed
            within 10-20 minutes, through a process called mining.
